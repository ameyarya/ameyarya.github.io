Hi, thanks for visiting. I am an iOS engineer that balances seamless design with scalable engineering. With a strong foundation in SwiftUI, UIKit, and server-driven UI, I focus on frameworks and tools that make apps faster, more reliable, and easier to evolve. My work spans performance optimization, real-time observability, and infrastructure that empowers teams to deliver features with confidence. I care about both the user experience on the surface and the developer experience under the hood.
